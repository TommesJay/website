accu:rate has been successfully simulating pedestrian flows for 2 years using our modern, scientific simulation model.
We want to offer the software we use in customer projects as a product.

Therefore, we would like to give technically inclined customers and interested engineers the opportunity to test the beta version of our software *crowd:it*.


## What is crowd:it?

* crowd:it is a software package for microscopic, agent-based simulation of pedestrians and generally people.
* crowd:it is developed in-house based inter alia on [Prof. Gerta Köster](das-team#gerta-koester)'s Optimal Steps Model and [Dr. Angelika Kneidls](das-team#angelika-kneidl) research at TUM
* crowd:it passes the complete [RiMEA e.V.](http://www.rimea.de/) test suite for pedestrian simulation software - [See our results](rimea-testanalyse) (currently only in German)


## Features of crowd:it

* We work with a continuous space model: Any point can be entered by a pedestrian. A fit of the model to the geometry is therefore not necessary (in contrast to cellular automata)
* Focusing on individual agents makes the reproduction of individual properties easy

* crowd:it offers an intuitive user interface. We strive for ease of use. This simplifies the working process and leads fast to results
* Floor plans are created using AutoCAD, a tool many engineers already are familiar with

## System requirements

* Windows 7 or higher
* AutoCAD 12 or higher
* Java 8
* 4 GB RAM
* Internet access

Even if you are using a Mac, your AutoCAD version is older or you have another CAD software, we are happy to tap into additional platforms with you!


## How does the beta program work?

We are looking for technically savvy customers who want to participate in our beta program. In the beta version of crowd:it you can try out a pre-release software as software testers. 
Your feedback will help us to identify problems and make crowd:it even better. 
You will receive unlimited technical support.
You will be in direct contact with our development team to ensure that you get a tool that gives you optimal support in your projects.


## Do I have to pay for the software?

Unfortunately we can not comp the beta software, but of course you'll not only get the test software but also the complete version of crowd:it when it's released.
