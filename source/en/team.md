After her studies in computer science at the Technical University of Munich Dr. rer. nat. Angelika Kneidl worked as an IT consultant in the financial services industry. In 2009 she returned to the Technical University of Munich and did a doctorate on "Methods for imaging human navigation behavior in the modeling of pedestrian flows" at the Department of Computerized Modeling and Simulation During this period she has been awarded several times for her work: she was granted two Best Paper Awards and the promotion award of the Association of the Friends of the Technical University of Munich, which honors excellent promotions.

At accu:rate she is the expert in modeling and is responsible for the project business. Contact Ms. Kneidl for all scientific and product-specific questions under: <span class="mailadresse" data-to="ak">ak@javascript.anti.spam</span>.

The [Munich University of Applied Sciences](http://www.cs.hm.edu/die_fakultaet/ansprechpartner/professoren/koester/index.de.html) researches the modeling and simulation of pedestrian flows since 2010, when Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Köster took up her professorship of Scientific Computing. Since 2007 Prof. Köster has been working in security research, in particular in the investigation and modeling of crowd flow simulations. Until 2010 she was responsible for the issue "Crowd Control" and lead the subprojects on personal flow simulation in the BMBF projects [SinoVE](http://www.bmbf.de/de/22453.php) and [REPKA](http://www.bmbf.de/de/22399.php) at Siemens AG, Corporate Technology Department. In her research she arrpeciates robust processes and applicability to practically implement scientific progress.

Since 2010 she leads a research group at the Munich University of Applied Sciences, working on pedestrian flow simulations. In the BMBF project [MEPKA](http://www.cs.hm.edu/aktuelles/news/newsarchiv2008/news_detailseite_19648.de.html) the „[Optimal Steps Model](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.86.046108)“ was developed, that allows people to have a variable step length to come closer to the target. In the BMBF project [MultikOSi](http://www.multikosi.de/teilvorhaben-der-hm) she and her team explore how psycho-social behavior can be meaningfully integrated into computer models.

Prof. Köster is member of the scientific committees of the [PED 2012](http://www.ivt.ethz.ch/news/archive/20120606_conference_ped_2012//), the [TGF 2013](http://www.fz-juelich.de/conferences/tgf13/EN/Home/home_node.html) and the [PED 2014](http://www.ped2014.nl/en), some of the most important conferences on crowd flow simulations.



### Technical University of Munich, Prof. Dr.-Ing. André Borrmann {#andre-borrmann}

The [Chair of Computational Modeling and Simulation](https://www.cms.bgu.tum.de/) under the direction of [Prof. Dr.-Ing. André Borrmann](https://www.cms.bgu.tum.de/de/team/borrmann) researches on the modeling and simulation of pedestrian flows since its inception in 2012. One of the research priorities of the Department are scale transitions between different modeling levels (macroscopic, mesoscopic, microscopic) in pedestrian flow simulations. Among other thigs the Chair is involved in Research Cooperation [MultikOSi](http://www.multikosi.de/), which is promoted by the [BMBF](http://www.bmbf.de).

The services of [VDS GmbH](http://www.vds-veranstaltung.de/) are based on 25 years of professional qualification and practical know-how in visitor and event security. These include security consulting for operators, promoters and authorities and the generation and implementation of security concepts in the form of safety coordination for events. One focus of the company is the Crowd Management (visitor management), which was successfully used for example in the championship celebration of FC Bayern Munich in 2013. Since 2013 the VDS GmbH manages as project coordinator the research project [MultikOSi](http://www.multikosi.de/) promoted by the [Federal Ministry of Education and Research](http://www.bmbf.de/), that is spread over three years. The aim of the project is to explore support systems for the secure conception and implementation of major urban events. The managing director Roland G. Meier is an expert in event security and places of assembly since 2009. Since 2013 he is certified by the [German Association of Professional Experts (DGSV)](http://www.dgusv.de/) and accredited "Safety Expert for places of assembly" (certificate of the  [TÜV Saarland](http://www.tuev-saar.net/)). Mr. Meier is the first Chairman of the [Federal Association of Event Security](http://bvvs.org/).
