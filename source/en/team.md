In February 2016 Benjamin Aaron Degenhart completed [his bachelor thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292995085_Implementierungskonzepte_fur_Agenten_in_Personenstromsimulationen_-_Effiziente_Modellierung_komplexer_Charaktere) which he has written in cooperation with accu:rate under the direction of Prof. Köster an the University of Applied Sciences in Munich.
Following he decided to support the accu:rate team as a working student.
His tasks are, for example, software development (mostly using Java) and 3D visualization of the simulations with Unity 3D.



## Supporters

Even if we cannot mention all people who support us at the moment or supported in the past, without the spirit of many of them accu:rate wouldn't be what it is today.

## Partners

### Munich University of Applied Sciences, Prof. Dr. Gerta Köster {#gerta-koester}

![Photo: Prof. Dr. Gerta Köster](/img/team/team-koester.jpg) {.mugshot}
The [Munich University of Applied Sciences](http://www.cs.hm.edu/die_fakultaet/ansprechpartner/professoren/koester/index.de.html) researches the modeling and simulation of pedestrian flows since 2010, when Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Köster took up her professorship of Scientific Computing. Since 2007 Prof. Köster has been working in security research, in particular in the investigation and modeling of crowd flow simulations. Until 2010 she was responsible for the issue "Crowd Control" and lead the subprojects on personal flow simulation in the BMBF projects [SinoVE](http://www.bmbf.de/de/22453.php) and [REPKA](http://www.bmbf.de/de/22399.php) at Siemens AG, Corporate Technology Department. In her research she arrpeciates robust processes and applicability to practically implement scientific progress.

Since 2010 she leads a research group at the Munich University of Applied Sciences, working on pedestrian flow simulations. In the BMBF project [MEPKA](http://www.cs.hm.edu/aktuelles/news/newsarchiv2008/news_detailseite_19648.de.html) the „[Optimal Steps Model](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.86.046108)“ was developed, that allows people to have a variable step length to come closer to the target. In the BMBF project [MultikOSi](http://www.multikosi.de/teilvorhaben-der-hm) she and her team explore how psycho-social behavior can be meaningfully integrated into computer models.

Prof. Köster is member of the scientific committees of the [PED 2012](http://www.ivt.ethz.ch/news/archive/20120606_conference_ped_2012//), the [TGF 2013](http://www.fz-juelich.de/conferences/tgf13/EN/Home/home_node.html) and the [PED 2014](http://www.ped2014.nl/en), some of the most important conferences on crowd flow simulations.

Meier is an expert in event security and places of assembly since 2009. Since 2013 he is certified by the [German Association of Professional Experts (DGSV)](http://www.dgusv.de/) and accredited "Safety Expert for places of assembly" (certificate of the  [TÜV Saarland](http://www.tuev-saar.net/)).
